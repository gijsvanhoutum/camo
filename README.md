# Calibration of Laser Triangulation based Vision Systems under Motion

What if we could calibrate a camera using an calibration artifict that is 
printed by a 3D printer itself? That is what this project was about. Please check
out the [documentation](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/camo/blob/master/report/0872274-CalibrationOfLaserTriangulationBasedVisionSystemsUnderMotion.pdf) 
or take a look at a [presentation](https://github.com/gijsvanhoutum/camo/blob/master/report/0872274-CalibrationOfLaserTriangulationBasedVisionSystemsUnderMotion.pdf)
